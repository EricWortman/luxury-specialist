Application Overview
I will be creating a web app that displays my provided services as a automotive product specialst. The end user will be able to see an overview and referecnce to past jobs I've done for clients. I'll also have a page with contact details.
# I did not get the chance to get referances. I also decided that one page was enough for now.

I'll be utilizing HTML and CSS to create functional and aestethicaly please webpage. My page will be created with GitHub and the URL is purchased through GoDaddy. The URL for the website will be www.luxury-specialist.com. I'll have multiple email addresses at this domain as well.

Feature List
A website with an overview of services for the user to observe. There will be contact details for myself. I'll have pictures that represent the kind of work that I do. Hopefully my limited CSS skills will allow my to make the site look professional.
# I don't think it looks super profesional at this time but I plan to continue to work and learn new skills

Future Feature List
I would like to add a rotating gallery at some point. I would also like to incorporate a blog that I can quckly updarte outside of programming language, this way maybe mobile uploads would be possible on my end. I think contact forms are somewhat outdated, but I may have on that just allows a user to input their details and an email would be sent to me to respond to them with. I'd like to incorporate a professional looking signature for my emails as well. Future I think I'd juts like to really polish the professional look
# The rotating gallery is in place and also features a fading animation thanks to Keyframes. I did not get to make a signatures yet but I will once I get a logo desinged. The logo will also be incorporated to the site later.
